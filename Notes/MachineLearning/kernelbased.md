## Kernel-Based Learning

### Support Vector Machines

Support vector machine is a technique to create a decision boundary by a hyperplane discriminating classes. The support vector machine tries to create a hyperplane, that maximizes the margin between classes.

### Least-Mean-Square Regression

### Kernel Discriminant Analysis

The kernel tricks is a lightweight procedure to perform, what feature expansion to higher dimensions does, however without ever transforming the data. We take advantage of the existence of some specialized functions, that allow us to compute the inner product of two vectors in higher dimension.
