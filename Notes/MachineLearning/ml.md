# Data Analytics (Machine Learning)

Machine Learning (ML) is a branch within Data Science to construct algorithms, that are self-improving based on statistical models. ML approaches can be classified into 3 main categories;

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning

Is the learning task of mapping an input vector to an output response. Supervised learning uses data labelled by human experts. The learning phase tries to optimize the model to correctly map the input to the labeled output. The model are then used to predict the response of unlabeled data. Model are either used for regression or classification, depending on wether the data is continuous or discrete.

## Unsupervised Learning

Is the learning task of finding commonalities in forms of structure and patterns in unlabeled raw test data. The algorithm are unsupervised i.e. without human help.

## Reinforcement Learning
The training process is iteratively the model is presented an input and guesses an output. An expert corrects the guess only by binary feedback. Depending on the feedback the training either updates the model or continue the process.

**Data Analytics**
Machine Learning is also known as Data analytics. Data Analytics is the discovery, interpretation and communication of meaningful patterns in data. Typically the analysis is four-fold; data preprocessing, data representation, representation preprocessing and model selection/training.

An example using image data:
1. Data preprocessing $\rightarrow$ image segmentation
2. Data representation $\rightarrow$ vectorizing
3. Representation preprocessing $\rightarrow$ centering
4. Model selection $\rightarrow$ classification

## Regression

## Classification

### Multi-class Classification
