## Neural Networks

Selecting number of neurons in hidden layers rules of thumb;

> - The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer.
> - The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer.
> - The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.
