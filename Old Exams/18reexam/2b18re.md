# Exercise 2
Now let $f$ be subject to the constraint, $h(x_1,x_2)=0$ where $h(x_1,x_2)=x_1^2+x_2^2-4$.

b) Find the maximum and minimum for $f$ in the feasible set $F=\{(x_1,x_2)|h(x_1,x_2)=0\}$
Argue for your calculations.

To find both minimum and maximum of f subject to the constraint h I use the lagrange multiplier
method.

$$F = \{x,\lambda\} = f(x) - \lambda (h(x))$$

Putting in the above expression we get

$$F = \{x,\lambda\} = x_1\cdot x_2 - x_1 - \lambda (x_1^2+x_2^2-4)$$

Removing the parenthesis following the lambda we get

$$F = \{x,\lambda\} = x_1\cdot x_2 - x_1 - \lambda\cdot x_1^2 - \lambda\cdot x_2^2+ \lambda\cdot 4)$$

We thereafter take the partial derivative of $x_1$, $x_2$ and $\lambda$

$$\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_1} = x_2 - 1 - \lambda \cdot 2x_1$$

$$\frac {\partial f}{\partial x_2} = x_1 - 1 - \lambda \cdot 2x_2$$

$$\frac {\partial f}{\partial \lambda} = x_1^2 - x_2^2+4$$

> Help from here on; We can isolate $x_1$ and $x_2$ to solve for lambda as we did in 18exam 2b. Is there another easier solution or what are we missing? 

c) Argue that the maximum of $f$ on the set $D=\{(x_1,x_2)|h(x_1,x_2)\leq0\}$ is the maximum found in b) (Note: $D$ includes both the circle AND the interior of the circle).
